      Without this option, @link(Download) may return other streams,
      for example TFileStream (that may not have good buffering, depending on OS)
      or TBase64DecodingStream (that may not allow seeking).

      Using TMemoryStream means that reading is fast and comfortable,
      but eats memory and doesn't allow to simultaneously read and process
      the contents (the file must be fully loaded, e.g. downloaded from
      the Internet, and ungzipped, before this function returns).
      So use this option only for files that aren't too big.

{ Return a stream to read given URL.
  Returned stream is suitable only for reading, and the initial position
  is always at the beginning.
  Overloaded version also returns a MIME type (or '' if unknown).

  Any errors are reported by raising exceptions.

  A local file URL is always supported,
  without using any networking library. URL without any protocol is always
  treated like a local filename (absolute or relative to current dir),
  so this function can be a drop-in replacement for normal file reading.
  The MIME type for local files is guessed based on their extension.

  A data URI scheme (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)
  is also always supported.
  The MIME type for such content is specified explicitly in URI.
  TODO: right now, soGzip is ignored for data URIs, we never filter them
  through gunzip.

  It also automatically supports protocols to embed script contents:
  ecmascript, javascript (see VRML and X3D specifications),
  castlescript, kambiscript (see https://castle-engine.io/castle_script.php),
  compiled (https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions.php#section_ext_script_compiled).
  The MIME type for these is implied by the protocol (like "application/javascript"
  for ecmascript/javascript), and the returned stream simply contains
  script code.

  Set EnableNetwork to @true to have also support for network protocols.
  Right now this means only http, handled by FpHttpClient.
  The MIME type for such content is usually reported by the http server
  (but if the server doesn't report MIME type, we still try to guess it,
  looking at URL using URIMimeType).

  On Android, URLs that indicate assets (files packaged inside .apk)
  are also supported, as @code(assets:/my_file.png).

  Note if you use a network URL (like http://...) and you read from this
  stream that you make a @bold(synchronous downloader).
  Which means that your application will wait until the data arrives
  from the Internet. This is why http:// support is disabled here
  by default (see @link(EnableNetwork)).
  This is sometimes acceptable (e.g. if you're
  waiting during the "loading" process, and the data just @italic(has)
  to be downloaded in order to continue), and it's really easy to use
  (you just download data exactly the same way like you open a local file).
  But often you may want to instead use @bold(asynchronous downloading)
  -- we plan to implement it by the class TDownload (see comments
  in CastleDownload code), but it's not ready yet!

  @raises(EDownloadError In case of problems loading from this URL.)
  @raises(EFOpenError If case opening the underlying file fails,
    raised in case of file:// URLs.)
  @raises(EStreamError If case reading the stream fails,
    raised in case of file:// URLs.)

  @raises(Exception Various TStream classes (used internally by this
    function) may raise various exceptions in case the stream cannot be created
    for reading.
    Right now, we simply let these exceptions to "pass through" from this function
    (instead of catching and re-raising).
    So, to be really safe, be ready that this function may raise @italic(any)
    Exception class.)

  { Download an URL asynchronously, without blocking the application.
    You can register a callback @link(OnFinished) or watch
    when the @link(Status) property changes to dsError or dsSuccess
    to detect when this finished downloading.

    The download starts when you construct the instance of this class.
    When it ends, the @link(OnFinished) is called and @link(Status) changes.
    You can also always just free an instance of this class, this will
    break the download immediately.

    Do not worry whether this uses threads (or not) internally.
    All the methods and properties of this class should be accessed
    from the main thread, the same thread you use for all Castle Game Engine
    functions. And the OnFinished is called in the main thread,
    so you can handle it without worrying about threading.

      Note that this constructor never calls OnFinished or changes @link(Status)

      Set this to @false to be able to free this TDownload instance
      (maybe even by setting @link(FreeOnFinish) to @true),
      and still keep the stream reference.
      It is your responsibility then to keep and free the @link(Content)
      stream whenever you want. }

      -1 if unknown.
      Depending on the server answer, this may be known fairly quickly after
      starting the download, or if may not be known at all (until we finish
      the download).
      It's guaranteed that this is know (not -1) when @link(Status) = dsSuccess,
      in all other cases always be prepared that this may be equal -1. }

      want to be bothered with managing the memory usage of this TDownload
      instance.

      Just like with TThread.FreeOnTerminate, be extremely careful after you
      have set this property to true: the instance of TDownload
      may become invalid at any moment (even right after when you have set
      the FreeOnFinish to @true, in case the contents were already downloaded).
      It is always freed in the main CGE thread (to avoid risk when iterating
      over @link(Downloads) list).

      You should always register the OnFinished callback before setting
      this to @true, to be notified when the download finishes.
      The OnFinished callback will be your last chance to get the downloaded
      data (unless you set FreeOnFinish := @false inside OnFinished
      implementation, which is allowed). }
    // Maybe resign from this property, it is dangerous -- is it really much useful?

{ Open a proper stream to read a file, fast (with buffering) and with seeking.
  This gives you a stream most comfortable for reading (buffering means
  that you can read small, comfortable pieces of it; seeking means
  you can jump freely to various file positions, back and forward).

  On different OSes or even compilers this may require a little different
  stream, so it's safest to just use this function. For example,
  traditional Classes.TFileStream doesn't do buffering. Although under Linux,
  the buffering of file handles is done at kernel level (so everything
  works fast), on Windows the slowdown is noticeable.
